        <h1>The Stringing Tool</h1>
       
        <p>The Stringing Tool is a digital application to sketch complex 3D objects. It is a digital modeling tool in a space with few constraints while no scale is applied. Having options to draw in a minimalistic manner and easily adjust proportions makes it possible to use Computer-Aided Design in earlier stages of the design process.</p>

        <h1>Prologue</h1>
        <p>The hammer has been invented to drive nails into materials. Just as this has opened up new ways of creating complex structures, tools can also become a limiting factor for how we approach problems. Our capacity to solve complex challenges is to a large extent determined by our capacity to understand a problem well enough while fighting the tendency to go with the first "best" solution that our brain jumps to.</p>
        <p>When equipped with a hammer, some things will inevitably look like a nail, as the saying goes.</p>
        <p>This is exactly how our thinking is shaped by the tools we are familiar with. They circle back on our thinking.</p>
        <p>“We design our world, while our world acts back on us and designs us.”</p>
        <p>In the process of designing a new object, one eventually comes to a point where computer-aided design (CAD) is used. CAD software allows us to create, modify, and optimize designs in a digital space. It enables us to take an idea further, store, render, or build tools around it, like molds to produce an object on a large scale.</p>
        <p>Although CAD software can do all these good things, it can be seen as a bottleneck that a project has to pass. It is also very rarely used in the early stages of the design process, where pen and pencil methods or models are more common.</p>
        
        <h1>The hanging model</h1>

        <p>In the 1800 century the mathematician and ingenieur Giovanni Poleni invented the hanging model while working for Pope Benedikt XIV on the Petersdome. Later adapted by the Spanish Catalan architect Antonie Gaudi because he dislikes drawing and prefers to explore his designs, using scale models made of chains or weighted strings. </p>
        <p>It was long known that an optimal arch follows an inverted catenary curve, i.e., an upside-down hanging chain. Gaudí's upside-down physical models took him years to build but gave him more flexibility to explore organic designs, since every adjustment would immediately trigger the "physical recomputation" of optimal arches. He would turn the model upright by the way of a mirror placed underneath or by taking photographs.</p>

        <h1>The Stringing Tool</h1>

        <p>The Stringing tool is digital form of the hanging Model. By setting points and connecting them with lines outlines for meshes are created. Forcefields can influence connections to become curves. They can be moved around and changed in size. It is a digital modeling tool in a space with little constrains while no scale is applied. To enable more novelty in the practices of computer aided design.</p>
        <p>After setting the outlines, everything can still be adjusted to change proportions, similar to working with a model, but without losing the functionality of a drawing. A complex surface can be described with very few reference points, allowing the software to compute the lines after each modification to the points or force field without breaking the model. The lines can be used as tubes to create strings or pillars. For this purpose, only a radius is needed to extrude along the curve. The lines can also be used to construct a closed surface. In this case, three lines are required to close the surface properly.</p>
        <p>Having options to draw in a minimalistic manner and easily adjust proportions makes it possible to use CAD in earlier stages of design. This approach also enables drawing inspections without the usual limitations of traditional CAD workflows.</p>
